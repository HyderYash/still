# üìß Email Notification System Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up automatic email notifications for when users add, update, or delete image marks and comments in your StillColab application.

## üöÄ Features
- **Automatic Notifications**: Emails sent when marks/comments are added, updated, or deleted
- **Smart Recipients**: Notifies project owners and shared users (excludes the author)
- **Professional Templates**: Beautiful HTML emails with project links
- **Multiple Email Services**: Support for Resend, SendGrid, AWS SES, and custom SMTP
- **Database Logging**: Track all notification attempts and results
- **Real-time Triggers**: Database triggers automatically fire notifications

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Notification Database Schema
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase_notification_setup.sql` into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

This will create:
- `notification_logs` table for tracking sent notifications
- Database triggers for automatic notifications
- Functions for notification handling
- RLS policies for security

### Step 2: Verify the Setup
Check that the following were created:
- ‚úÖ `notification_logs` table
- ‚úÖ Database triggers on `image_marks` and `image_comments`
- ‚úÖ `send_notification` function
- ‚úÖ RLS policies enabled

## üîß Edge Function Setup

### Step 1: Deploy the Edge Function
1. Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **Edge Functions** section
3. Create a new function called `send-notifications`
4. Copy the code from `supabase/functions/send-notifications/index.ts`
5. Deploy the function

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
In your Supabase Edge Function settings, add these environment variables:

```bash
# Required
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Email Service (choose one)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Optional
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## üìß Email Service Configuration

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Verify your domain for sending emails

### Option 2: SendGrid
1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Set `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` environment variables

### Option 3: AWS SES
1. Configure AWS SES in your AWS account
2. Set AWS credentials and region environment variables
3. Verify your domain or email addresses

### Option 4: Custom SMTP
1. Configure your SMTP server details
2. Set SMTP environment variables
3. Test the connection

## üîÑ Frontend Integration

### Step 1: Install the Notification Service
The notification service is already integrated into your `imageMarkService.ts` file. It will automatically send notifications when:
- Adding new marks
- Updating existing marks
- Deleting marks

### Step 2: Test Notifications
1. Open an image in marking mode
2. Add a new mark with a comment
3. Check your email (and other project members' emails)
4. Verify the notification was sent

## üìã How It Works

### 1. **User Action**
- User adds/updates/deletes a mark or comment
- Frontend saves the data to database

### 2. **Database Trigger**
- Database trigger automatically fires
- Calls the `send_notification` function
- Prepares notification data

### 3. **Edge Function**
- Receives notification request
- Fetches project and user details
- Determines recipients (project owner + shared users)
- Generates email content
- Sends emails via configured service

### 4. **Email Delivery**
- Professional HTML email sent to all recipients
- Includes project link and action details
- Logs success/failure in database

## üé® Email Template Features

- Mobile-friendly design

## üîê Security Features

### **RLS Policies**
- Users can only view their own notification logs
- Project-based access control
- Secure data handling

### **User Privacy**
- Author is never notified of their own actions
- Only project members receive notifications
- No sensitive data exposed in emails

### **Rate Limiting**
- Built-in error handling
- Fallback mechanisms
- Graceful degradation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Notifications Not Sending**
1. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
